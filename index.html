   <h1>Introduction</h1>
       <p>I'm a healthcare data analyst at the Bronx VA Medical Center starting to learn front-end development. The tools I commonly use at work are SQL Server Management Studio and Reporting Services, Pyramid Analytics, R, Looking Glass Clinical Analytics, and ArcGIS. I'm also a fifth-year doctoral student in Public Health at the City University of New York.</p>
    <p>Medical errors and health disparities are issues that I'd like to try to address using health information technology. Since I started working in healthcare 20 years ago, electronic health records have changed very little. The Internet, cloud-based technologies, and SaaS have the potential to lead to real advances in healthcare, but it won't be easy for the small companies and independent developers; the market is dominated by a few giants. Even so, I remain optimistic!</p>

    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>Originally I'm from Missouri Valley, a small town in Southwest Iowa, but I've spent my adult life in cities: Minneapolis, Washington, D.C., and for the last 10 years New York. What I love most about New York is the feeling that anything is possible here. The city is like a living creature; neighborhoods are always changing - new restaurants and shops popping up, fun food trends (hello food trucks and cronuts!), and more opportunities to see and hear art and music than you can shake a stick at. Currently I'm 10 years into a hopefully never-ending quest to find the best pizza in NYC.</p>

    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <h2>What are your favorite hobbbies?</h2>
    <p>Favorite hobbies include sailing, sewing, photography, and baking. It's hard to make time for everything. Also, I walk a lot.</p>
    <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
    <p>My dream job is to develop interactive, data-driven applications that are informative and fun to use. I'm not sure exactly what I would like my focus to be: web only or web and mobile, healthcare only, or include other topics like food and the environment. Learning front-end development is the first step.</p>
    <h2>What's your background?</h2>
    <p>My background is mainly in managing and analyzing clinical healthcare data. I've also taken graphic design, programming, and usability courses. Time to tie it all together.</p>
    <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
    <p>I like all different kinds of music and have a lot of friends who are musicians, so I like to listen to their stuff. Lately I've been listening to Debbie Deane and The Lark Quartet. I've also been revisitng Carole King's "Tapestry" since seeing the Broadway musical "Beautiful."</p>
